# Overview

I wanted to enumerate the screens and how they're put together for the current app. 

These files are used for a 1-off code generation.  It might make sense to build keep these as a living (re-runnable) code generator, but I suspect that won't be of too much use.

# screens.json5

This is an inventory of the distinct screens in the app.

# navigation.json5

This is how those screens are assembled.
