  "privacyPolicy": "Last Updated: June 19, 2017\n\nThis Privacy Policy for the MADE-2-FIT application (or “Policy”) tells you how Bare Escentuals Inc. for its bareMinerals brand (“bareMinerals,” “we,” or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects information obtained from and about our customers (“you”). It also tells you how you can access and update your information and make certain choices about how your information is used. This Policy covers both our online and offline data collection activities, including information that we collect through our various applications. By using a bareMinerals’ application or by otherwise giving us your information, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, you must not use our applications or give us any of your information.\n\nIf we want to change the way we handle your information, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy. For material changes (i.e., substantially new practices you wouldn’t expect from us or that we didn’t previously tell you about), we may decide to notify you more prominently and/or give you prior choice. We reserve the right to make changes to our practices and this Policy at any time, provided that we follow the procedures above.\n\nThis Privacy Policy answers the following questions:\n\n1. How do we collect information from you?\n2. What information do we collect?\n3. How do we use your information?\n4. Do we use cookies to gather information?\n5. With whom do we share your information?\n6. How do we protect your information?\n7. Other important policy information\n8. How can you contact us with questions?\n9. California “Do Not Track” Notice?\n10. California Privacy Rights\n\n1. How do we collect information from you?\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information that we, bareMinerals, collect from or about our customers through the methods described below.\n\nWe may combine information collected via one method (e.g., a bareMinerals website) with information collected via another method (e.g., a bareMinerals store boutique). We do this to get a more complete view of our customers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more personalization. Also note that not all of the methods listed below may be relevant to you.\n\n•   bareMinerals’ websites and applications\n\nWe may collect information from you through one of our U.S. or international websites or applications. This could include (a) any site that we own and control under our own domain (such as bareminerals.com, bareminerals.co.uk, or some other domain name that redirects you to one of these sites), or (b) any site or web application that we may develop and run on a third party social network such as Facebook. This could also include any site or application that we specifically design for use on a cell phone or other mobile device, such as a mobile-enabled site (i.e., WAP site) or mobile application (e.g., iPad/iPhone app). This Policy will only apply if it is posted or linked to on the website or application which you are using.\n\n•   bareMinerals’ store boutiques\n\nWe may collect information from you at one of our mall retail stores or mobile kiosks. This may take the form of a printed registration card (such as sign up for our Friends and Benefits Program or “FAB”) or other information collected during checkout. Our store boutiques are available in the U.S. and in some locations outside the U.S. (e.g., United Kingdom). In some instances, these boutiques may be found within other department stores.\n\n•   bareMinerals’ text messaging programs\n\nWe may collect information from you through one of our inbound text messaging programs. For example, periodically we may allow customers to send us inbound text messages using a short code that we create and advertise in connection with a special offer or promotion. These programs might be advertised in one of our store boutiques or on one of our websites or applications. If you choose to participate in one of these programs, information about your physical geo-location may be collected (with your permission) and used for marketing purposes (see “Marketing Communications” under Section 3 below for more information).This Policy will only apply if the bareMinerals text messaging program indicates it applies or refers you to our website to view the relevant privacy policy.\n\n•   Call center orders\n\nWe may collect information from you through our call centers, for example if you place an order over the phone or via fax or postal mail to our customer service department. These methods of ordering are available in the U.S. and in some locations outside the U.S. (e.g., Japan). Our call centers may also collect information from you in connection with our FAB Friends and Benefits program or to respond to your question or comment or other follow-up request.\n\n•   Email correspondence\n\nWe may collect information from you if you correspond with us via email. For example, if you send an email to our customer service department or use the “Email Leslie” feature, we may obtain certain information about you (such as your contact email address) and use it to follow up.\n\n•   Data collected from other sources\n\nOccasionally, we may obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may hire a third party data aggregator or vendor to provide us additional information about our existing customers (this is known as “data appending”), including information from your profile or postings on a third party social network. We may also receive information from third party co-sponsors who we may partner with occasionally to run special promotions or giveaways. We may also receive information about customers in the event we acquire other companies.\n\n2. What information do we collect from you?\n\nDepending on how you interact with bareMinerals (online, in-store, on the phone, etc.), we may collect from you various types of information, which are described in more detail below. In some instances (and unless we say otherwise below), we may combine one type of information with another type of information, and store them together in our records. In all cases, however, we strive to limit the amount of information we collect and store to that which is necessary to provide you the relevant services.\n\n•   Personal contact information\n\nThis includes any information that would allow us to personally contact you, such as your name, home or mailing address, phone number (home, cell, etc.), or email address. In some cases, this could include information that you give us about someone else (for example, if you ask us to ship a bareMinerals product to a friend). We typically collect personal contact information in connection with a variety of activities, including account registration (e.g., FAB Friends and Benefits Program, Club/Auto-Renewal Program, online shopping and website community features, newsletter sign-up, etc.), product orders, customer service, contests and promotions, and customer feedback. If you create an account with us, some of your personal contact information may be stored under your account profile. To review or edit this information, go to the relevant “My Account” section of our site or contact Customer Service.\n\n•   Payment information\n\nThis includes any information that you use to make a purchase, such as your credit card details (cardholder name, card number, expiration date, etc.), gift card information, check or other forms of payment (if such are made available). This also includes the billing name and address associated with your form of payment. We only collect payment information for purchases (whether your purchase is made in-store, online, by phone, or via catalogue). If you create an account with us (e.g., Friends and Benefits account, Club/Auto-Renewal account, Shopping/Community account, etc.), your payment information (along with your purchase history and other related preferences) may be stored under your account profile. To review or edit this information, go to the relevant “My Account” section of our website or contact Customer Service. \n\n•   Account login information\n\nThis refers to any information that is required for you to establish a unique account with us or for us to give you access to your specific account information. Examples include customer number, login ID, screen name, password, and/or security question and answer. Certain login information, such as your customer number, may be generated by us and then sent to you. We only collect (or create for you) unique login information for those activities that require an account, such as Friends and Benefits or Club/Auto-Renewal membership. Your unique login information, especially your password, should always be kept confidential and should never be shared with anyone else. To change your account password, go to the relevant “My Account” section of our site or contact Customer Service. \n\n•   Demographic information\n\nThis includes any information that describes demographic or psychographic characteristics. Examples may include your date of birth, age or age range, gender, facial attributes (e.g., hair color, eye color, skin type, skin tone, etc.), general geographic location (e.g., zip code or city and state), favorite products, hobbies and interests, or lifestyle information. We typically collect demographic information in connection with a variety of activities, including account registration (e.g., FAB Friends and Benefits Program, Club/Auto-Renewal Program, online shopping, website community features, newsletter sign-up, etc.), contests and promotions, and customer surveys. If you create an account with us, you may be allowed to modify certain demographic information stored under your account profile. To do so, go to the relevant “My Account” of our site or contact Customer Service. For demographic information associated with your profile on a third party social network (e.g., Facebook), see separate paragraph on “Social network information” below. \n\n•   Technical computer info\n\nThis includes any information about the computer system or other technological device that you may be using to access one of our websites or applications. We typically collect this information through the use of automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons. For more on cookies, see Section 4 below. Examples of technical computer information that may be collected include your computer’s IP address, operating system type, and web browser type. If you access a bareMinerals website or application via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone’s unique device ID, location, and other similar mobile device data. Technical computer information is not typically associated with your personal contact information. \n\n•   Website and application usage information\n\nThis includes information about how you use and navigate our websites and applications, including which links you click on, which pages or content you view, and other similar information or statistics about your interactions with our websites or applications (e.g., date and time of visit, which site you came from, etc.). This information is captured using automated technologies such as cookies and web beacons, and may be collected regardless of the device you may be using (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.). This information may also be collected using third party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) that collect data in aggregate (such as number of visits to a particular page or the amount of time spent on a site). We may also use these technologies, such as web beacons, to capture information about how users respond to certain email campaigns (e.g., time the email is opened, where users link to from that email, etc.). Website usage information may be associated with your personal contact information if you provide such information to us. For more on cookies, see Section 4 below. \n\n•   Customer feedback\n\nThis includes information that you voluntarily share with us about your experience in using our products or services, including our beauty products, websites and applications, and store boutiques. Examples may include comments and suggestions, testimonials, or other feedback you send us about what you may have liked (or disliked) about your experience in using our products or services. We typically collect this information in the form of customer surveys, feedback forms, and email correspondence (e.g., “Email Leslie” feature). \n\n•   Customer-generated content\n\nThis refers to any content that you create and then share with us (and perhaps others) by uploading it to one of our websites or applications, such as our Facebook fan pages or applications. Examples may include photos, videos, personal stories, or other similar media or content. We mostly collect customer-generated content in connection with contests and promotions, website community features, customer engagement, and third party social networking. \n\n•   Social network information\n\nThis refers to any information that is part of your profile on a third party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third party social network to share with us or that you post publicly. Examples may include your basic account information (e.g., name, email address, profile picture, gender, birthday, current city, user ID, list of friends, etc.) and any other additional information or activities that you permit the third party social network to share with application developers or that you post publicly on a bareMinerals social networking page. For example, we may receive your social network information (or parts of it) when you download or interact with a bareMinerals application on a social networking site (such as Facebook) or use a third party social networking feature that is integrated within a bareMinerals site (such as Facebook Connect). To learn more about how your social network information may be obtained by bareMinerals (or other application developers), please visit the website of the relevant third party social network. \n\n•   Other information (depending on context)\n\nThis refers to any other information that we might need to collect for a specific bareMinerals form, feature, or other service that you use or request. What this information might include will vary depending on the method of collection and the specific purpose(s) for which the information is being collected. Please see Section 3 below for more specific examples. \n\n3. How do we use your information?\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the various purposes and features for which we might collect and use your information, and the different types of information that might be collected for each. Please note that not all of the uses listed below will be relevant to every customer.\n\n•   Order fulfillment\n\nWe may collect and use your information to process and ship your orders, to inform you about the status of your orders, and to follow up with you about your satisfaction with the ordered products. Depending on how you make a purchase (e.g., through an application, online, in-store, call center, etc.), this could involve the collection and use of certain personal contact information, payment information, account login information, and/or information related to your purchase (such as products ordered). This could also involve the ongoing storage of your payment information to allow for easier checkout on future purchases.\n\nPlease note that there are many independent e-commerce sites that sell bareMinerals products but that are not controlled or operated by bareMinerals. Because these sites may have different \
    privacy and security practices than we do, we recommend that you read their privacy policies before making any purchases on those sites.\n\n•   Account maintenance\n\nWe may use your information to maintain your accounts with us, including administering any customer loyalty or rewards programs associated with such accounts (e.g., Friends and Benefits). This typically involves the use of the information that was originally collected to set up your account (e.g., personal contact information, payment information, account login information, demographic information, etc.). \n\n•   Customer service\n\nWe may collect and use your information to provide you customer service, including responses to your inquiries. This typically requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as your name, email address) and information regarding the reason for your inquiry (e.g., order status, technical issue, product question, general question, etc.). Customer service may be provided through various forms of communication, such as email correspondence and call center support. \n\n•   Product improvement and customization\n\nWe may collect and use your information so we can constantly improve our products, tailor them to your needs, and come up with new product ideas. This mostly involves the collection and use of demographic information and customer feedback. \n\n•   Personalized product recommendations\n\nWe may use your information to provide you with bareMinerals product recommendations, offers, and rewards that are tailored to your interests and profile (for example, as part of our Friends and Benefits Program). This mostly involves the use of your previous order history (including online, boutique, and call center purchases), as well as certain demographic information (such as your favorite look, unique facial attributes, birth date, etc.). \n\n•   Contests and Promotions\n\nWe may collect and use your information to administer a contest, sweepstakes, giveaway, competition, or other similar marketing campaign or promotion. These events typically require the collection and use of personal contact information (for prize fulfillment), limited demographic information (for eligibility), and, in some cases, customer-generated content. Some promotions with customer-generated content or a social networking component will be run on third party social networks such as Facebook (e.g., on bareMinerals’ Facebook fan page or application). To comply with sweepstakes laws, we may publish or share limited information about promotion winners (such as name and city of residence). For more information about our contests and other promotions, please see the official rules or details posted with each promotion. \n\n•   Marketing Communications\n\nWe may collect and use your information to send you marketing communications, such as email communications, mobile messages (including text and/or push notifications), and postal mailings. These communications may inform you about new products, store events, special discounts and coupons, beauty tips, and other news and special offers. On occasion, these communications may also contain information or offers about third party products.\n\nSending you marketing communications mostly requires the collection and use of certain personal contact information and/or demographic information. In some instances (such as for mobile messages), this may involve the use of technical information or precise geo-location information obtained from your mobile device. This allows us to send you messages directly to your mobile device, including offers and coupons based on your location.\n\nYou can always opt-out from receiving marketing communications either by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each such communications or by updating your device settings for mobile messages. If you have an online account with us (e.g., Friends and Benefits account, Club/Auto-Renewal account, Shopping/Community account, etc.), you may be given the option to change some of your communication preferences under the relevant “My Account” section of our site or by calling Customer Service. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving marketing communications, you may still receive other communications from us, such as order confirmations, notifications about account activities (e.g., account confirmations, password changes, website community postings, etc.), and other important announcements (e.g., product recalls, privacy policy changes, etc.). \n\n•   Website and application personalization and convenience\n\nWe may collect and use your information to personalize your experience and save you time when you visit our websites and applications. This is typically done through the use of automated technologies (such as cookies) that collect and remember certain account login information, technical information, and/or previous website usage information. For example, we might remember your login ID or username so you can quickly login the next time you visit our site or so you can easily retrieve the items you previously placed in your shopping cart. Based on this type of information, we might also show you specific bareMinerals content or offers that are more relevant to your interests. \n\n•   Website and application community features\n\nWe may collect and use your information to give you access to our website community features, such as features that may allow you to upload and share ratings, reviews, questions/answers, stories, pictures, videos, or other content. This typically involves the collection, use, and (in some instances) public display of certain personal contact information, account login information, demographic information, and/or customer-generated content. Because these types of features are “communal” in nature, information you post in these areas may be visible to others. Please use caution when using these features or uploading content to a bareMinerals site or application. For some community features, you may have the ability to control whether some parts of your profile can be seen by others and whether we send you notifications about certain community activities (like the fact that one of your questions has been answered). To access these settings, go to the “My Account” section of our site and login to the relevant community account. For community features that are integrated with third party social networks such as Facebook, see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking” below. \n\n•   Website viral features (e.g., tell-a-friend)\n\nWhere permissible under applicable law, we may request and use your information so you can use our website viral features, such as tell-a-friend. These features allow you to easily share certain bareMinerals’ news, product information, promotions, wish list items, or other content with family members and friends. These features typically require the collection and use of certain personal contact information (such as email addresses and names) so that the selected message or content can be delivered to the proper recipients. In some instances, this information may be stored in our records so we can track and reward our customers for their referrals. For tell-a-friend or other viral features offered by third party social networks (such as Facebook “Share” and “Like” features), see separate paragraph on “Third party social networking” below. \n\n•   Third party social networking\n\nWe may collect and use your information when you interact with third party social networking features, such as Facebook Connect, Facebook Like, Pinterest, and Instagram. These tools may be embedded into our sites or applications for the purpose of running contests, allowing you to share content (such as beauty tips, articles, stories, etc.), allowing you to sign up for certain bareMinerals accounts, or for other stated purposes. If you use these tools, we may have the ability to obtain certain information about you from your social networking profile (see “Social network information” under Section 2). You can learn more about how these features work, and the profile data we may obtain about you, by visiting the website of the relevant third party social network. \n\n•   Third party online advertising\n\nWe may allow third party ad networks to collect and use your information to show you targeted ads (including bareMinerals’ ads) on our sites or on other sites. Some of these ads may entice you to come back and revisit our site for new offers and promotions. This type of advertising typically involves an ad network collecting and tracking certain technical information (such as your IP address) and website usage information (such as your browsing history) on our sites and across many other sites on the Internet. This does not involve the collection, use, or sharing of your personal contact information, such as your name or email address. You can opt-out from this type of third party tracking at any time by going to: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. \n\n•   Other general purposes (e.g., website and application security, internal research)\n\nWe may collect and use your information for other general business purposes, such as to maintain the day-to-day operation and security of our websites and applications and to conduct internal marketing and demographic studies. These activities mostly require the collection and use of certain personal information, demographic information, technical computer information, website usage information, and customer feedback. \n\n4.

With whom do we share your information?\n\nWe may share your information with the types of companies or in the situations described below. We do not rent or sell your information to third party companies for their own marketing use.\n\n•   Third party vendors\n\nThese are outside vendors, agencies, or contractors we hire to help us run our business (e.g., fulfill orders, operate our websites, run promotions and marketing campaigns, operate our call center, etc.). The information shared with our vendors could include personal contact information, payment information, demographic information, or other types of information depending on the service being provided by the vendor. For some vendors, we may need to transfer your information to locations outside your home country, such as to the United States. Our vendors are only allowed to use your information for the specific tasks we’ve hired them to do, and for no other purpose. They’re also required to keep your information confidential and secure.\n\n•   Legal disclosures (when necessary)\n\nThis is when we may need to share your information for law enforcement or other legal purposes. This type of sharing may be necessary in connection with a lawsuit, claim or investigation, governmental inquiry, court order, enforcement of legal rights (e.g., contract terms, intellectual property rights, etc.), safety issue, or other similar legal or security matter. Sharing your information for these reasons is not a regular event, but could arise from time to time. We will strive to limit the types and amount of information we may need to share for legal purposes to that which is reasonably necessary. \n\n•   Business transfers (e.g., sale or acquisition of company)\n\nWe may share (or receive) information about you, including personal contact information, in the event of an acquisition, merger, sale, corporate restructuring, bankruptcy, or other similar event that involves Bare Escentuals Inc. or its parent or affiliated companies. If such an event occurs, we will take reasonable steps to require that your information be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy, unless it is not practicable or permissible to do so. \n\n•   Affiliated Companies  \n\nWe may share (or receive) information about you, including personal information, with our corporate affiliates, including our parent company, Shiseido.   For additional information regarding our corporate affiliates, please see http://www.shiseidogroup.com.\n\n6. How do we protect your information?\n\nWe use a variety of standard methods (described below) to keep customer information confidential and secure. Please note, however, that these protections do not apply to any information you choose to share in public areas such as our website community features or other social areas.\n\n•   Secure operating environments\n\nWe store your information in secure operating environments that are protected from the public and that we only allow authorized bareMinerals employees and agents/contractors to access on a need-to-know basis.\n\n•   Encryption for payment info\n\nWe use industry-standard encryption to provide greater protection for sensitive financial information, such as your credit card information or other payment information, when such information is sent to us over the web. For example, encryption is used when you make payments through our online store, as well as if you choose to have your payment information stored with us for future online purchases.  \n\n•   Other security measures\n\nIn addition to the methods above, we may take other measures to protect your information, depending on the sensitivity of the data and other considerations \
    (such as how the information is collected and where it is stored). These measures may include (among other things) additional access restrictions, password requirements, and physical protections (e.g., secure data centers, etc.).    \n\n•   Measures you can take\n\nDespite all of our efforts, no security safeguards or standards are guaranteed to provide 100% security.  It is also important for you to play a role in keeping your information safe and secure. When signing up for an online account, please be sure to choose an account password that is hard for others to guess and never to reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, never choose to have your login ID or password remembered and make sure to log out of your account every time you leave the computer. \n\n7. Other important policy information\n\nThis section provides additional information that is important for you to know about this Policy or our practices.\n\n•   Your information may be transferred outside your home country\n\nWe may have a need to transfer our customer information (regardless of where you live) to other countries or places in which we or our agents/contractors maintain offices or facilities. By using a BE website or application or by otherwise doing business with Bare Escentuals, you are agreeing to allow us to transfer your information outside your home country and to process it inside the United States or elsewhere for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.\n\n•   We do not collect information from children\n\nWe do not solicit or collect any type of information from a person known to be under the age of 13. If we discover that we have accidentally collected information from a child, we will remove that information from our records as soon as feasibly possible (or obtain the necessary parental permission to retain it). \n\n•   We are not responsible for third party sites/features\n\nOur websites and applications may provide links to, or features from, other third party sites (such as third party social networks) that we do not own or control. If you click on such links or use such features, you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for the content or practices of any third party site, application, or feature. \n\n8.

Almost all customer service disputes can be resolved to the customer’s satisfaction by contacting our customer service by email at customerservice@bareminerals.com or by phone at (888) 795-4747. If your dispute cannot be resolved using our customer service team, these Terms of Use describe how we shall proceed with the resolution of the dispute.\n\nAGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. ARBITRATION IS A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO BRING SUIT IN COURT.\n\nTHIS SECTION CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nIF YOU ARE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:\n\nWE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE: You and bareMinerals agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms of Use through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate bareMinerals’ intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances bareMinerals may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the App, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\n\nWHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. Thus, you agree that you are waiving your right to sue or go to court to secure relief, and instead agree to the arbitration process as stated in this provision. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\n\nARBITRATION PROCEDURES: The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration \
    in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To initiate arbitration, you or bareMinerals must do the following things:\n\n(1) Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.\n\n(2) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office.\n\n(3) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\n\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and bareMinerals will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than $1,000, bareMinerals will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor. Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States county where you live or work, New York county, or any other location we mutually agree to, subject to New York law. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nAUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and bareMinerals, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and bareMinerals. The arbitrator’s decision may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nNO CLASS ACTIONS: You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\n\nWAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and bareMinerals in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND BAREMINERALSWAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.\n\nOPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing bareMinerals at adroptout@bareminerals.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) a copy (may be a screenshot) of Terms and Conditions and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms and Conditions. The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms of Use by using the App.\n\nCHOICE OF LAW/FORUM SELECTION.\n\nIn any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules.
